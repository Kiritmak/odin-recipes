    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      When you think about cool, contemporary desserts taking the food world by
      storm, there are two words that likely don't come to mind: soft serve. As
      in, soft serve ice cream. But while we were busy marveling at
      gooey-centered molten chocolate cake – and while molecular gastronomists
      were whipping ice cream over liquid nitrogen – soft serve ice cream was
      making a serious comeback, in New York, LA, Portland, and beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make your own soft serve, use your ice cream machine. Instead of
      freezing the ice cream for the recommended time, serve it when it's in its
      soft state, just frozen enough to hold its shape. Just put it into a
      pastry piping bag and squeeze it out to get that classic soft-serve swirl.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound strawberries</li>
      <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup light corn syrup</li>
      <li>1/3 cup water</li>
      <li>
        1/8 tsp xanthan gum (a natural stablizer that's easy to find at
        specialty supermarkets)
      </li>
      <li>1 cupcoconut cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Making the Base</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Remove the green tops from the strawberries and slice them into perfect
        slices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the green tops from the strawberries and slice them into perfect
        slices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the strawberries from the oven and allow to cool to room temp.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the berries are cooled, puree them really well with a blender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pass the berries through a fine mesh strainer to get out most of the
        remaining pulp and seeds.
      </li>

      <li>
        Stir together about one fourth of the sugar with all of the xanthan gum
        in a small bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the water in a small saucepan, add the sugar mixture and
        immediately whisk vigorously until very smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the corn syrup. Set the pan over medium heat and cook, stirring
        often and adjusting the heat if necessary to prevent a simmer, until the
        sugar has fully dissolved, about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the heat and immediately whisk in the strained berry puree
        and the coconut cream.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the soft serve base into an airtight container and refrigerate
        until well chilled, about four hours, or, for even better texture and
        flavor, 24 hours.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Churning the Soft Serve</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour the soft serve base into a standard at-home ice cream maker and
        turn on the machine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Churn just until the mixture has the desired texture of soft serve,
        about 15 to 25 minutes depending on the machine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a spatula to scoop all of the ice cream into a piping bag and pipe
        the ice cream out into a cone!
      </li>
      <li>
        This soft serve could be stored, covered, in the freezer for up to two
        weeks but should be very tediously tempered before eating after being
        frozen.
      </li>
